# 🔢 Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset

A machine learning project that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset** using neural networks.  
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation for image classification.

## 📌 Overview
- **Dataset**: MNIST (60,000 training images + 10,000 testing images)  
- **Task**: Multi-class classification (digits 0–9)  
- **Models**: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- **Goal**: Achieve high accuracy in digit recognition while visualizing learning curves and predictions.
