# Digit-Recognition-using-MNIST-dataset
This project implements a digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset, one of the most popular benchmark datasets in machine learning. The goal is to classify grayscale images of digits (0â€“9) into their correct categories using a Feedforward Neural Network / Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
